Issues/ToDo List:
* Place logo in the center of the middle top navbar.

* Reports can't be viewed by data, user, search, or division yet.
* Report creating is currently unusable do to visual UI (invisible text, poorly formatted entry, nothing but entry boxes, etc).
* Reports 'Created Date' is rendering outside of the box when viewing an individual report. I would like it moved to a new line right below, 'Chaplain Division:'.

* Prayer Request UI needs changed for readability (currently comments blur with the background, I would like more of a rounded white box container style like the rest of the app).

* Messages can't be deleted (in groups, individually, or by whole conversation. If this is implemented you will have to run delete requests to my SQL server, AND to firebase).
* Messages text entry box is to0 high (add when tapped the keyboard goes away), and needs a more visually UI friendly rounded box container around it.

* The schedule isn't creating working when users attempt to create new calendar events. 
- Issue: SQL isn't being updated when the creation happens, and the calendar doesn't render any new events to the UI.

* 
* Notifications need wired for:
	- Prayer Requests
	- Calendar
	- News and Announcements
